lparallel
=========

lparallel is a library for parallelism in Common Lisp.

See http://lparallel.com for documentation and examples.

lparallel should run on any Common Lisp implementation supported by
bordeaux-threads. The following implementations successfully pass the
test suite:

  * ABCL
  * Allegro
  * Clozure
  * LispWorks
  * SBCL

These are the only implementations which have been tested so far.

To run the tests, load lparallel-test.asd and call lparallel-test:execute.
